Java

Khalid says the key to grasping, understanding, and making sweet Java music is to go Dr. Manhattan on OOP concepts. Creating working methods and variables for re-use without compromising security and to help Brain take over the world.


Here you'll find mental handsprings of 4 main OOP concepts in Java:

1. Abstraction
KISS principle. Objects, classes, variables that rep more complex layers underneath (code & data).

2. Encapsulation
Allow access only to VIP guest list. Pragmatic Programmer says to write "shy code".

3. Inheritance
Like cheescake on cheat-day...this speciality lets me create new blueprints that share some of the attributes of other classes. Don't reinvent the cheesecake wheel.

4. Polymorphism
Pretty much what a homonym is...same word, different meanings, different contexts.
a. Overloading - dif menaings implied by code
b. Overriding - dif meanings implied by values of variables
